<h1><b>Oversized Gift</b></h1>
<hr/>
<p style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif';font-size: 40px;">The oversized gift is used to explain the value of talent over character. It explains that when a person’s talent is valued more than their character, bad things start to happen. The individual starts to believe that their character, their personality isn’t important to them. It is evident that the oversized gift is present when celebrities such as Justin Bieber, or Michael Jackson. Those two are 2 examples, but are not the only two who have the same problem. Justin Bieber had his talent discovered at a very young age. As a result, ever since he was very young, his talent had always been what everyone had seen him for. Justin Bieber and Michael Jackson alike had the same problem. Both people had their talent valued so heavily, that their character was ignored for the most part. This lead to both of their characters never getting the opportunity to ‘grow up’. As a result, both people had done things that can be deemed stupid and idiotic which is due to their ‘Oversized gift’.
