<h1>Opportunity Statue</h1>
<hr/>
<p style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif';font-size: 40px;">The opportunity statue is a metaphor used to describe how opportunities can pass you. The metaphor is derived from a statue in Athens which depicts a man with long hair in the front of his face, which represents opportunity, The back of his head is bald, which represents how opportunity can pass you by. The metaphor is very important to me as because it shows how fast opportunity can come, and go. Imagine yourself with a very important leader who is also powerful, and they offer you a position at their company. This position may be a one time deal, and you may never receive another opportunity. This is when opportunity statue comes into play, since you will only get one opportunity and you may never get another chance at this opportunity. If you act now, you may receive a once in a lifetime opportunity. However, if you don’t take it, chances are it will never appear again. In other words, you have walked past the hair that you needed to grab onto to seize the opportunity. Now, you’re stuck with the bald head with no more opportunity for anything special. </p>
