<p style="font-size: 40px;">The most valuable concepts to me are The Opportunity Statue and Oversized Gift. The most important one to me is the Oversized gift as because it teaches you to not neglect character because of talent. This is important to me because it proves why child musicians are doomed from the start. Their character is neglected. Opportunity statue is also important to me as because it relates to my situations I've had happen to me. I have missed many opportunities just by not acting soon enough. I personally believe that these two are the single most important concepts to take away from the book.
